These rapid vibrations spin the water molecules at high frequency causing cavitation, a brief phase change in the water molecule. Cavitation gently removes the dead surface skin cells and cleans out follicles without the irritation and inflammation that is sometimes associated with mechanical methods. The rapid expansions and contractions of the vibrating hand piece also destroy skin bacteria by causing the single wall of the bacteria cells to implode.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Radiofrequency produce radio waves. These radio-waves penetrates the skin layers to selectively heat the skin tissue and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Radiofrequency works on two main principles: 1. When radiofrequency energy meets collagen the resulting resistance and heat causes the collagen to contract and tighten. The heat also stimulates the production and growth of new collagen fibres, making this ideal for areas of loose and sagging skin on the face and body that require tightening. 2. When radio frequency energy meets fat the resulting resistance and heat causes the breakdown of pockets of fats and fluids, allowing them to be removed naturally by the body&rsquo;s lymphatic and vascular system. This an ideal treatment to aid the reduction of cellulite and fat.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fractional radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fractional radiofrequency provides direct heating to both the epidermis and dermis by precise control of the depth of needles from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. The radiofrequency energy is transferred deep into the dermis, creating an even heating, hence stimulating contraction and regeneration of collagen fibers. Simultaneously, microneedles penetration produces hundreds of tiny dermal micro channels. The microscopic punctures stimulate collagen production in the dermis layer as it breaks some of the blood vessels directly below the surface of the skin while the untreated tissue that acts as a &#39;&#39;free&#39;&#39; biological reserve grants a fast recovery and the absence of side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Capacitive radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Capacitive radiofrequency means that the RF energy is transferred &quot;by capacity&quot; (principle of the electrical capacitor) to the skin via a external application electrode/handpiece. The electrode is covered with an insulating film which acts as dielectric and the body acts as a second plate of the capacitor. A return plate closes the circuit. The energy circulation through the resistive medium formed by the tissues increases the temperature in proximity of the electrode at more superficial level when compared to resistive radiofrequency. The treatment triggers biological responses within the skin that lead to tissue regeneration whilst preserving natural cell physiology.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Resistive radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Resistive radiofrequency is different from the capacitive radiofrequency in that the application electrode is not insulated, allowing the current to be transferred directly to the skin with less dispersion, thus obtaining an increase in temperature at a greater depth.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Electroporation</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Electroporation uses modulated currents at low intensity that creates new extracellular pathways. This alteration to the cell membrane allows a higher permeability to a large variety of hydrophilic molecules, which would otherwise not be able to enter the cell. Once formed , these electropores open from a few seconds to a few minutes. Thanks to these electrical pulses, which allow the opening of intercellular &ldquo;doors&rdquo;, the cocktail of active ingredients are able to penetrate in depth bypassing the skin barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The syringe applicator</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The syringe applicator can be used in synergic technologies mode or with individual technology. It combines both the effect of radiofrequency and electroporation favoring the nourishment of the tissues through the deep transdermal delivery of active ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Electrode roll dispenser</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>It gradually and uniformly allows to distribute the formulation released from a 20cc syringe placed in the applicator.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fractional electrode</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The fractional electrode delivers fractional radiofrequency and electroporation superficially on the epidermis or directly into the dermis, ensuring a precise control of the depth from 0.25 to 2.5 mm. The fractional electrode as well as opening invisible micro-channels, also allows to stimulate collagen formation in order to improve sagging skin, wrinkles, acne scars, large pores and stretch marks.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Low frequency ultrasound</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The ultrasound generator produces 28 KHz and involves the transformation of electrical energy into low frequency sound waves that are transmitted into the tissues by the handpiece to create a mechanical vibration. It is similar to the energy produced by a vibrating tuning fork, just that it is a higher frequency, and not audible. It is called ultrasonic because these sound waves are just above the upper limit of human hearing. The cavitational effect generated by the sound waves create a mechanical vibration that cause tons of microscopic air bubbles to surround the fat cell&rsquo;s membranes and with its resonant frequency, the bubbles cause a high pressure that lead the fat cells to break up instantly. The broken cells are then processed by the liver and safely metabolized out of human body which will be assisted by the assumption of abundant drinking water. Ultrasound cavitation produces lipolysis of fatty acids from adipocytes (fat-laden cells) and increased cell permeability of the adipocytes thanks to a phenomenon known as stable cavitation.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Technology</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Procedures</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Technical Data</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Pubblications</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Cavitational micropeeling</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ultrasonic peeling uses a hand piece similar to a small spatula, containing ceramic/quartz heads that when excited by an electrical current emit piezoelectric vibrations that cause the hand piece to vibrate at 24,000 vibrations per second on the skin surface.

The results can be seen immediately after the first session, and moreover Mesotherm treatments can be combined with other aesthetic treatments, such as filler, Botox, etc.</p>\r\n', '<p>General specifications</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment activation:&nbsp;</strong>button touch-screen<br />\r\n<strong>Power supply:&nbsp;</strong>230 Vac 50/60 Hz<br />\r\n<strong>Output:&nbsp;</strong>150 W (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>320x650x580xmm (HxLxD)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dermoabrasion</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abrasion material:&nbsp;</strong>aluminium oxide<br />\r\n<strong>Suction:&nbsp;</strong>50 kPa (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Laser wavelenght:&nbsp;</strong>635 nm<br />\r\n<strong>Laser power:&nbsp;</strong>1 mW<br />\r\n<strong>Laser class:&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RF handpiece functions:</strong>&nbsp;unipolar<br />\r\n<strong>Unipolar function frequency:&nbsp;</strong>from 350 Hz ut to 1 MHz<br />\r\n<strong>Power:&nbsp;</strong>50 W (max)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electroporation</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frequency:&nbsp;</strong>1.1 KHz modulated signal in amplitude with modulating sinusoidal frequency 0.5 Hz<br />\r\n<strong>Maximun intensity on the plate:&nbsp;</strong>0.8 mA for 10 cm2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Body/face suction</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suction:&nbsp;</strong>50 kPa (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Mode:&nbsp;</strong>continued/pulsed</p>\r\n', '<p>General specifications</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment activation:&nbsp;</strong>button touch-screen<br />\r\n<strong>Power supply:&nbsp;</strong>230 Vac 50/60 Hz<br />\r\n<strong>Output:&nbsp;</strong>150 W (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>320x650x580xmm (HxLxD)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dermoabrasion</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abrasion material:&nbsp;</strong>aluminium oxide<br />\r\n<strong>Suction:&nbsp;</strong>50 kPa (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Laser wavelenght:&nbsp;</strong>635 nm<br />\r\n<strong>Laser power:&nbsp;</strong>1 mW<br />\r\n<strong>Laser class:&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RF handpiece functions:</strong>&nbsp;unipolar<br />\r\n<strong>Unipolar function frequency:&nbsp;</strong>from 350 Hz ut to 1 MHz<br />\r\n<strong>Power:&nbsp;</strong>50 W (max)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electroporation</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frequency:&nbsp;</strong>1.1 KHz modulated signal in amplitude with modulating sinusoidal frequency 0.5 Hz<br />\r\n<strong>Maximun intensity on the plate:&nbsp;</strong>0.8 mA for 10 cm2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Body/face suction</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suction:&nbsp;</strong>50 kPa (max)<br />\r\n<strong>Mode:&nbsp;</strong>continued/pulsed</p>\r\n', '<ul>\r\n	<li>David Kist et al.&nbsp;<em>Lasers in Surgery and Medicine</em>&nbsp;38:150&ndash;154 (2006)</li>\r\n	<li>Uwe Paasch,&nbsp;<em>Journal of the german society of dermatology</em>&nbsp;2009, 7, 196-203</li>\r\n	<li>Pavan K.

(24, 24, '<p>Cavitational micropeeling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultrasonic peeling uses a hand piece similar to a small spatula, containing ceramic/quartz heads that when excited by an electrical current emit piezoelectric vibrations that cause the hand piece to vibrate at 24,000 vibrations per second on the skin surface. These rapid vibrations spin the water molecules at high frequency causing cavitation, a brief phase change in the water molecule. Cavitation gently removes the dead surface skin cells and cleans out follicles without the irritation and inflammation that is sometimes associated with mechanical methods. The rapid expansions and contractions of the vibrating hand piece also destroy skin bacteria by causing the single wall of the bacteria cells to implode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency produce radio waves. These radio-waves penetrates the skin layers to selectively heat the skin tissue and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Radiofrequency works on two main principles: 1. When radiofrequency energy meets collagen the resulting resistance and heat causes the collagen to contract and tighten. The heat also stimulates the production and growth of new collagen fibres, making this ideal for areas of loose and sagging skin on the face and body that require tightening. 2. When radio frequency energy meets fat the resulting resistance and heat causes the breakdown of pockets of fats and fluids, allowing them to be removed naturally by the body&rsquo;s lymphatic and vascular system. This an ideal treatment to aid the reduction of cellulite and fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractional radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractional radiofrequency provides direct heating to both the epidermis and dermis by precise control of the depth of needles from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. The radiofrequency energy is transferred deep into the dermis, creating an even heating, hence stimulating contraction and regeneration of collagen fibers. Simultaneously, microneedles penetration produces hundreds of tiny dermal micro channels. The microscopic punctures stimulate collagen production in the dermis layer as it breaks some of the blood vessels directly below the surface of the skin while the untreated tissue that acts as a &#39;&#39;free&#39;&#39; biological reserve grants a fast recovery and the absence of side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacitive radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacitive radiofrequency means that the RF energy is transferred &quot;by capacity&quot; (principle of the electrical capacitor) to the skin via a external application electrode/handpiece. The electrode is covered with an insulating film which acts as dielectric and the body acts as a second plate of the capacitor. A return plate closes the circuit. The energy circulation through the resistive medium formed by the tissues increases the temperature in proximity of the electrode at more superficial level when compared to resistive radiofrequency. The treatment triggers biological responses within the skin that lead to tissue regeneration whilst preserving natural cell physiology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resistive radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resistive radiofrequency is different from the capacitive radiofrequency in that the application electrode is not insulated, allowing the current to be transferred directly to the skin with less dispersion, thus obtaining an increase in temperature at a greater depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electroporation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Electroporation uses modulated currents at low intensity that creates new extracellular pathways. This alteration to the cell membrane allows a higher permeability to a large variety of hydrophilic molecules, which would otherwise not be able to enter the cell. Once formed , these electropores open from a few seconds to a few minutes. Thanks to these electrical pulses, which allow the opening of intercellular &ldquo;doors&rdquo;, the cocktail of active ingredients are able to penetrate in depth bypassing the skin barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The syringe applicator</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The syringe applicator can be used in synergic technologies mode or with individual technology. It combines both the effect of radiofrequency and electroporation favoring the nourishment of the tissues through the deep transdermal delivery of active ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electrode roll dispenser</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It gradually and uniformly allows to distribute the formulation released from a 20cc syringe placed in the applicator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractional electrode</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fractional electrode delivers fractional radiofrequency and electroporation superficially on the epidermis or directly into the dermis, ensuring a precise control of the depth from 0.25 to 2.5 mm. The fractional electrode as well as opening invisible micro-channels, also allows to stimulate collagen formation in order to improve sagging skin, wrinkles, acne scars, large pores and stretch marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low frequency ultrasound</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultrasound generator produces 28 KHz and involves the transformation of electrical energy into low frequency sound waves that are transmitted into the tissues by the handpiece to create a mechanical vibration. It is similar to the energy produced by a vibrating tuning fork, just that it is a higher frequency, and not audible. It is called ultrasonic because these sound waves are just above the upper limit of human hearing. The cavitational effect generated by the sound waves create a mechanical vibration that cause tons of microscopic air bubbles to surround the fat cell&rsquo;s membranes and with its resonant frequency, the bubbles cause a high pressure that lead the fat cells to break up instantly. The broken cells are then processed by the liver and safely metabolized out of human body which will be assisted by the assumption of abundant drinking water. Ultrasound cavitation produces lipolysis of fatty acids from adipocytes (fat-laden cells) and increased cell permeability of the adipocytes thanks to a phenomenon known as stable cavitation.</p>\r\n', '<p>Cavitational micropeeling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultrasonic peeling uses a hand piece similar to a small spatula, containing ceramic/quartz heads that when excited by an electrical current emit piezoelectric vibrations that cause the hand piece to vibrate at 24,000 vibrations per second on the skin surface. These rapid vibrations spin the water molecules at high frequency causing cavitation, a brief phase change in the water molecule. Cavitation gently removes the dead surface skin cells and cleans out follicles without the irritation and inflammation that is sometimes associated with mechanical methods. The rapid expansions and contractions of the vibrating hand piece also destroy skin bacteria by causing the single wall of the bacteria cells to implode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiofrequency produce radio waves. These radio-waves penetrates the skin layers to selectively heat the skin tissue and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Radiofrequency works on two main principles: 1. When radiofrequency energy meets collagen the resulting resistance and heat causes the collagen to contract and tighten. The heat also stimulates the production and growth of new collagen fibres, making this ideal for areas of loose and sagging skin on the face and body that require tightening. 2. When radio frequency energy meets fat the resulting resistance and heat causes the breakdown of pockets of fats and fluids, allowing them to be removed naturally by the body&rsquo;s lymphatic and vascular system.

These rapid vibrations spin the water molecules at high frequency causing cavitation, a brief phase change in the water molecule. Cavitation gently removes the dead surface skin cells and cleans out follicles without the irritation and inflammation that is sometimes associated with mechanical methods.

These radio-waves penetrates the skin layers to selectively heat the skin tissue and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Radiofrequency works on two main principles: 1. When radiofrequency energy meets collagen the resulting resistance and heat causes the collagen to contract and tighten. The heat also stimulates the production and growth of new collagen fibres, making this ideal for areas of loose and sagging skin on the face and body that require tightening. 2. When radio frequency energy meets fat the resulting resistance and heat causes the breakdown of pockets of fats and fluids, allowing them to be removed naturally by the body&rsquo;s lymphatic and vascular system. This an ideal treatment to aid the reduction of cellulite and fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractional radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractional radiofrequency provides direct heating to both the epidermis and dermis by precise control of the depth of needles from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. The radiofrequency energy is transferred deep into the dermis, creating an even heating, hence stimulating contraction and regeneration of collagen fibers. Simultaneously, microneedles penetration produces hundreds of tiny dermal micro channels. The microscopic punctures stimulate collagen production in the dermis layer as it breaks some of the blood vessels directly below the surface of the skin while the untreated tissue that acts as a &#39;&#39;free&#39;&#39; biological reserve grants a fast recovery and the absence of side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacitive radiofrequency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacitive radiofrequency means that the RF energy is transferred &quot;by capacity&quot; (principle of the electrical capacitor) to the skin via a external application electrode/handpiece. The electrode is covered with an insulating film which acts as dielectric and the body acts as a second plate of the capacitor. A return plate closes the circuit. The energy circulation through the resistive medium formed by the tissues increases the temperature in proximity of the electrode at more superficial level when compared to resistive radiofrequency.

This alteration to the cell membrane allows a higher permeability to a large variety of hydrophilic molecules, which would otherwise not be able to enter the cell.

It is called ultrasonic because these sound waves are just above the upper limit of human hearing. The cavitational effect generated by the sound waves create a mechanical vibration that cause tons of microscopic air bubbles to surround the fat cell&rsquo;s membranes and with its resonant frequency, the bubbles cause a high pressure that lead the fat cells to break up instantly. The broken cells are then processed by the liver and safely metabolized out of human body which will be assisted by the assumption of abundant drinking water.
